# Timer-Implementation-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to use the timer module in a PIC microcontroller to generate time delays or periodic interrupts. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. Timers are essential for accurate time-based operations in embedded systems.
