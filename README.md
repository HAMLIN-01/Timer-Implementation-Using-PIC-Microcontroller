# Timer-Implementation-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to use the timer module in a PIC microcontroller to generate time delays or periodic interrupts. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. Timers are essential for accurate time-based operations in embedded systems.
# Features
Uses the PIC microcontrollerâ€™s built-in timer module.
Generates precise time delays or periodic interrupts.
Can be used for delay generation, event counting, or scheduling tasks.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC,
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: MPLAB IDE,
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The timer module is configured with a predefined clock source and prescaler.
The timer counts up to a specific value, triggering an interrupt or overflow event.
The system responds to the timer event, such as toggling an LED or updating a display.
